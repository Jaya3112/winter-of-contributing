# HTML Links

- Almost every web page contains one or two links atleast. These links allow users to jump from one document to another document by clicking on it.
- We can also say that HTML links are hyperlinks.
- When we move the mouse cursor over the link, the mouse cursor change into small hand which point over the link.
- A link can be button, image or any other HTML elements.It does not have to be text.


## Syntax

`<a>` tag explains a hyperlink. It has the following syntax :

```html
<a href=" ">text</a>
```
- `href` attribute is the most important attribute of `<a>`element which designate the link's destination (mostly it is URL).
- The _text_part is visible to reader.
